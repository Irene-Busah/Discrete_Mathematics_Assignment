# Question 4
# Write a programme that takes as input a finite set or list (you may decide) A and a list R where
# R is of the form (written mathematically):
# R = {(x1, y1),(x2, y2), ...,(xn, yn)}.
# Your code should first check if R is a relation on A (that is, if R is a set and if R ⊆ A × A).
# If R is not a relation on A, your programme should output a statement to this effect.
# If R is a relation on A then your programme should output which of the following properties
# the relation satisfies:
# a) reflexive,
# b) transitive, and/or
# c) symmetric.


# Input list R
# Number of sub lists

# The list containing the cartesian product of A(A * A)
product_a = []


# -------Code for to get user input for the values for the list R------
# Input list R
# Number of sub lists
# list_size = 2
# num_list = int(input("Please enter the number of sublist R you will input: "))
# list_r = [[int(input("Please enter a single number and press enter: ")) for _ in range(list_size)]
